# Meshmerize
Maze Solving Bot
This was my first ever attempt at a robotic device for a competition titled 'Meshmerize' held at IIT Bombay for their Techfest '18.
This repository contains the code and sources used by us to realize the project.
The aim of the bot is to solve a maze in two passes: First, the only condition is to reach the end point from the start point, including 
any redundancies; Second, it is to restart and reach the end point by eliminating any redundant paths taken in the first run.
Whilst we did not perform the best at the competition, we soon optimized our instance of the bot to make it work much better.
